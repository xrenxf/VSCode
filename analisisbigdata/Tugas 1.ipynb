The difference between a dynamic-type list and a fixed-type array is illustrated in the following figure:\n","\n","![Array vs List](https://github.com/stephenbaek/bigdata/blob/master/in-class-assignments/ica01/figures/array_vs_list.png?raw=1)\n","\n","The word 'Numpy' in the figure is something we will learn in a moment.

Again, the advantage of the list is flexibility: because each list element is a full structure containing both data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type. Fixed-type arrays lack this flexibility, but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data.\n","\n","In many data science applications, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental. For those applications, fixed-type arrays would be much more useful than dynamic-type lists, as all the elements we will be dealing with are essentially numbers. Furthermore, there are a lot of mathematical operations that we will need to apply to those numbers as we get to extract, transform, and analyze data.
